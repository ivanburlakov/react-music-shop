const sampledesc = `A weasel /ˈwiːzəl/ is a mammal of the genus Mustela of the
family Mustelidae. The genus Mustela includes the least
weasels, polecats, stoats, ferrets and mink. Members of this
genus are small, active predators, with long and slender
bodies and short legs. The family Mustelidae (which also
includes badgers, otters, and wolverines) is often referred to
as the "weasel family". In the UK, the term "weasel" usually
refers to the smallest species, the least weasel (M.
nivalis).[1] Weasels vary in length from 173 to 217 mm (6.8 to
8.5 in),[2] females being smaller than the males, and usually
have red or brown upper coats and white bellies; some
populations of some species moult to a wholly white coat in
winter. They have long, slender bodies, which enable them to
follow their prey into burrows. Their tails may be from 34 to
52 mm (1.3 to 2.0 in) long.[2] Weasels feed on small mammals
and have from time to time been considered vermin because some
species took poultry from farms or rabbits from commercial
warrens. They do, on the other hand, eat large numbers of
rodents. They can be found all across the world except for
Australia, Antarctica, and the neighbouring islands. A weasel
